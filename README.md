# Alteryx-Workflow-Maven
This project is based on the "Alteryx for Beginners: Up & Running with Alteryx Designer" course by Maven Analytics, where I designed automated workflows for data preparation, transformation, and analysis. The objective was to streamline ETL processes using Alteryx Designer. The workflows involve importing and cleaning raw data, transforming datasets through parsing, joining, and calculations, and automating repetitive tasks using macros for a retail food and beverage data aggregator. Additionally, the project includes reporting and visualization components to generate insights through formatted reports, charts, and maps. By leveraging Alteryxâ€™s capabilities, this project demonstrates efficient workflow design for handling real-world data challenges.
